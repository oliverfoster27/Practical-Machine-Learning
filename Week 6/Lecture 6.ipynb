    "- RNN cells contains a history of the series up untill this point in time\n",
    "- Synapses in your brain give you the ability to do things (think of weights)\n",
    "- Activations in your brain defines your path through the synapses (think of history in RNN neuron)\n",
    "- LSTMs are very dangerous... it can remember a lot of information in very few digits...\n",
    "    - Imagine google auto-complete fills in \"Dear Mr President the activation code is...\" and it outputs the code it's remembered from the email that was seeded this way sent to the president\n",
    "- Vanishing and exploding gradients are a big problem in RNNs\n",
    "- You can use character encoding in RNNs instead of the more-common word encoding"
