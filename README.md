# Practical Machine Learning

- This course is taken through the Professional Development Certificate for Data Science and Machine Learning at McGill University

- This course aims to introduce participants to essential machine learning methods and techniques through an end-to-end machine learning project.
- The emphasis is placed on practical experience with machine learning using Python programming language, scikit-learn and TensorFlow, as well as on understanding classification and training models. 
- The course will provide an introduction to artificial Neural Networks, deep learning, convolutional and recurrent neural nets and reinforcement learning.
